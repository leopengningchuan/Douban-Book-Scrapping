# Douban Book Scrapping
Parsing Personal Douban Reading

## Project Background
[Douban.com](https://www.douban.com) is a popular online platform and social network where users can discover, review, and share content related to films, books, music, events, and more. As an active user since 2012, I’ve written numerous reviews and articles about books and movies over the years. My experience with Douban has been both enriching and memorable.

However, Douban doesn’t offer a convenient way to export all user-generated content in one click. This raises concerns about data loss in the event of platform failure. To safeguard my reviews, I created a custom web parser to automatically extract and store all my book reviews locally. This ensures my content is securely backed up and easily accessible, regardless of the platform’s future.

## Project Goal
This project is focusing on using Python Jupyter Notebook to parsing the personal book reviews and comments in [Douban Book](https://book.douban.com).
